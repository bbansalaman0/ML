###Advance house prediction 


## Life cycle of Data science projects

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature engineering
3. Feature selection 
4. Model bulding
5. Model Deployement


## In Exploratory Data Analysis following steps are follow:
1. CHECKING FOR Missing values
2. All the numerical variables
3. Distribution of the numerical variables
3.1 CONTINUOUS AND DISCRETE VARIABLES
4. Cardinality(ALL) of catagorial variables
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent features(that is SalePrice)
8. TEMPORAL VARIABLES



## In Exploratory Data Analysis following steps are follow:
1. REPLACING MISSING VALUES FOR CATEGORICAL VALUES WITH MODE OR MISSING VARIABLE & FOR NUMERICAL VARIABLES WITH MEDIAN TO AVOID OUTLIERS
2. HANDLE DATE TIME VARIABLES
3. CONVERT NUMERICAL DATA INTO NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
4. HANDLE RARE CATEGORICAL VARIABLES 
5. FEATURE SCALING ( MINMAX_SCALING, STANDARD_SCALING, ONE_HOT_ENCODE, LABLE_ENCODE)
